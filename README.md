Water Quality is threatened by increasing temperatures and other conditions developed due to climate change. As such ,rivers experience changes in the physical and chemical water quality mainly due to increasing temperatures. This change in temperature changes the dissolved oxygen concentrations thus affecting the ecosystem that depends on this body of water. This interest led to the following question and hypothesis:

Question How does temperature affects water quality, specifically the water quality of Fraser River Main Arm? Hypothesis Temperature affects the water quality of the Fraser River seeing that chemical reactions in the river is influenced by temperature. Therefore increase in temperature can affect parameters such as dissolved oxygen

Technical Pieces of the Project:

1) Import data using pandas and read this file in as a table

2) Filter Data to arrive a specific columns that are necessary for the main goals of the project.

3) Change the column names, thus making it more readable

4) Run statistical model on the data:

Use liner regression to find the relationship between the main variables
