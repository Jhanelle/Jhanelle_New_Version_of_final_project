The main aim of this project is to understand the strains of C.elegans that sense carbon dioxide in the environment. This will be identified based on the speed of the worms which illustrates the worms capability of responding to carbon dioxide. Speed will be analyzed as speed and locomotion are indicators that suggest that the worms can sense carbon dioxide. 

** More information about the background this project can be found in the doc folder that holds my research proposal.

Technical Pieces of the Project:

1) Import data using pandas and read this file in as a table

2) Filter Data to arrive a specific columns that are necessary for the main goals of the project.

3) Group the different strains of the data as this would allow statistical methods to be done on the file easier 

4) Create a histogram for the speed and strain data to test if the data follows a normal distribution

5) Run a t-test on the speed and strain variables as this would show the strain that responds the best to carbon dioxide

6) Use linear modelling to compare the area covered by the worms in comparison to speed
